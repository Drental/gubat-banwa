Please attempt to follow code style present throughout the project. An ESLint profile is included to help with maintaining a consistent code style. All warnings presented by the linter should be resolved before an PR is submitted.

- `npm run lint` - Run the linter and display any issues found.
- `npm run lint:fix` - Automatically fix any code style issues that can be fixed.
