    "description": "<p><strong>Renders of Heaven, Denouncers of Kings, Cloud Surfers, Ever Alight Javelins, Attainment of Minor Enlightenment</strong></p><p>No gods, no rulers. This is the first Technique of the Piercers of Heaven. Their teachings then go on to teach of the great unbreaking, that unlashing from the earth, that great wind-calling. With a flex of your kalag, a honing of your Kinaadman, an expression of Gahum, you can fly upon silk wings to sail the clouds.</p><p>The first Heavenspear was Sarripada Pak-an. To fend off an incoming Akai raid, they rode upon catapults, and when the war barges sounded, they launched themselves into the air, sailing across the sky, and rending sails from masts and inflicting chaos upon the raiders.</p><p>The Sarripada would continue to do this until one day, he launched himself so high that he spoke with Lawu, the great eagle that will eat the sun. The eagle took him into his clutches and showed him the seven heavens, at the top of which there was no throne but simply infinite bliss. When asked why there was no great god that ruled over them all, the Eagle responded: “Rulership is a mistake and a lie built by your ancestors and descendants. Rejoice in the glory of combat.”</p><p>Sarripada Pak-an descended back into the earth upon a silken kite that he had fashioned himself with the help of biraddali--rainbow-winged angels--from one of the seven heavens.With this, he fought like a hawk, swooping and killing and destroying boats.</p><p>After fending off that particular raid, he returned to the cliff where his catapult was, and he broke it. With an intonation of his Kinaadman, he detached himself free from the earth. And upon this blasphemy against the natural order he founded a house of sky-warriors, and called them the Heavenspears. The Heaven Rending Style is then the truth of your Kinaadman: unbind yourself from the tyrant-gods of the earth, who lash you down to the ground.</p><p>“No thrones, rend heaven and hell.” As a Heavenspear, you are taught the Heaven-Rending Arts. These are a set of techniques that let you reflexively move about the air as if there were innumerable platforms about you, using your spirit to bounce off of thin air. This, combined with a martial art focused on using polearms, makes the Heavenspear adept at staying at range but also quick. Their unorthodox angles of attack has been the downfall of many warbands.</p><p>If you become a Heavenspear, ask yourself: with your enlightened knowledge of there being no Over God, why do you fight? Do you fight for liberation, so that all men can fly across the sky? Or do you fight for more selfish reasons? You rend the sky but make sure that your spear thrust is true, from your heart, and not from your doubts.</p>",
    "traits": "<h3>Liberation</h3><p><em>The final lie is the Earth-Binding. That one must stay bound to the earth. That one must fall down. BATALA, the Absolute Reality, tells that this reality is nothing but phenomenon that we can overcome. However, to achieve that, they must learn the truth of the Waling-Waling Surat: that they themselves are not real. That they travel and can perform feats of grand God-killing because reality as they know it is a structure of their own souls crafting reality around them. Only then can they truly unchain themselves from the shackles of the earth.</em></p><p>You can spend <strong>1 Beat</strong> to <strong>Unbind</strong> yourself. While Unbound, you are considered <strong>Flying</strong>. While Unbound, when you attack a Juggled enemy, you can consume the Juggled to immediately inflict <strong>Stop (1)</strong> and <strong>+1 True Hit</strong> on them.</p><p>If you Rush while Unbound, you may inflict <strong>1 Hit</strong> on an adjacent enemy at any point in the movement for free, 1/Fulmination.
