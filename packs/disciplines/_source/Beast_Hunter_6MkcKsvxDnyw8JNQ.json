    "description": "<p><strong>Martial Artists of the Perfect Hunt, Tamers of the Divine Wilds, Seekers of Truth and Hunters of Gods</strong></p><p>Hunting is a popular trade and profession in the isles. It's how one gets pig and meat, after all. And pig caught in the forest is a ritual sacrifice, filled with metaspiritual meaning and power. Hunting in the isles are done either by one's self, with traps, or with a dog or two, who can pin down game.</p><p>When war breaks out, and constant violence looms, specialized hunters arose, pointing their traps and their dogs at their enemies. They took it upon themselves. Now they train their children not only in the arts of hunting, but also in war. They call themselves the Beast Hunters, for they both hunt and handle beasts, and what are warriors but beasts of a different name? The Moon and Star Dance was an easy Martial Art to spread across the Isles. The Akai Clan that began the Moon and Star Dance is long gone,their traditions dispersed across all of the isles.</p><p>It was Akai that first saw their applicability in war, and began granting nobility and vassalage to hunters who would join the Sultanaâ€™s following and army. An even smaller contingent of elite hunters serve as her royal hunters, outfitted with silks and golds and jades.</p><p>Beast Hunters use a large variety of constructed traps to control the battlefield. They might bait their enemies, use strange pits to make them fall, or soften the soil to make them slip quicker. Beast Hunters are unmatched when it comes to manipulating the battlefield with their ingenuity and closest allies. They thrive in the mid-range, putting down traps to shut down enemy movement and skill.</p><p>Most importantly, the Moon and Star Dance focuses on flowing, mindful movements that incorporate the Sidereal Companion: Hunting Beasts. Hunting beasts are fierce and they never back down, and they even prefer to fight against things larger than them, the devil bastards. They rejoice in the glory of savaging a giant boar or crocodile or stag and bringing them writhing to the floor. The most common beast is a witch dog, forest canines that can climb trees and have constantly sharp claws, but common hunting beasts also include monkey-eating eagles, fierce civets, juvenile crocodiles, and sometimes even wild warty boars.</p><p>Beast Hunters are sought after for their trapmaking expertise and their peerless skill in surviving the deep forests. They come from all walks of life, and with their hunting companions, they can take on whatever challenge that will come their way, with a combination of their wit, their innovative skill, and the fierceness of their hunting beasts.</p><p>If you choose to be that consummate hunter, ask why you used your hunting and trade for battle. What made you hunt the ultimate predator? Why do you sic your hunting beasts at your fellow man?</p>",
