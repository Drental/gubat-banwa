There, those that would travel to the Tree of Life would be met by him, and taught by him. He emphasizes thus. Quoth Death: â€œYou are not beyond death. None are. Even immortality is temporary. Even the gods face death, for everything is part of the cycle of Diwa. Therefore, learn: something can only be beautiful if it ends.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Spend 1 Beat</strong> to strike quickly with a chopping bolo punch which weaves into a grapple. 1 adjacent fighter to you becomes <strong>Clinched</strong>. While Clinched, they suffer <strong>Stop</strong>, but they lose Clinched at the end of their Fulmination.</p><p><strong>Fight Ender: +1 Beat</strong> to immediately inflict violence, gaining <strong>Skewering</strong>. Clinch stays.</p><p><strong>Hurl Gods At Mountains: +1 Beat</strong> to immediately throw the target: <strong>push 5</strong> and if they collide, they suffer <strong>Slow (1)</strong>. Clinch ends.</p>",
