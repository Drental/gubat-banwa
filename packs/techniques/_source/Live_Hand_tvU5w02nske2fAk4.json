Your attacks flow into the next one, not one being a mistake, each one a set up for the next. All will fall under your salt, your weapons flash like lightning in your hands.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Prereq:</strong> Sea Demon Fire Pamaagi</p><p><strong>Spend 1 Beat</strong> to gain a <strong>Live Hand Token</strong>, of which you can only have 1 of at a time. When suffering a <strong>Melee Attack</strong>, spend the token to change the target back at the attacker or at another fighter adjacent to both you and the attacker.</p><p><strong>Lightning Hand: +1 Beat</strong> to enhance the Live Hand Token, letting you use it against Ranged Attacks as well.</p><p><strong>Dancing Furious Mad: +1 Beat</strong> to also <strong>Slide 1</strong> the attacker after the attack resolves.</p>",
