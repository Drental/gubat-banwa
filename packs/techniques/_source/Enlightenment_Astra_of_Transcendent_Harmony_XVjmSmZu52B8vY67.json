In the gentleness arises the greatest of violences. This is the Rusakpana: the Bow of Annihiliation. Rusak weapons are weapons made of pure annihilating god-essence, the weapons of the gods and those that invoke them.</p></blockquote><p>Whenever a fighter in range 5 of you suffers an attack, inflict 1 Hit immediately, 1/Fulmination.</p><p>At <strong>Strike 4+</strong>, spend 1 Beat and choose any target in the battlefield. Roll your <strong>Bravery+Faith</strong> against them, each hit being a true hit. If they are still in play, they suffer <strong>Stun (1)</strong>.</p>",
