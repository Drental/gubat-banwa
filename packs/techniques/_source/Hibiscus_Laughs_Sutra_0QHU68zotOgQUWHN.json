The Namulak spoke the mocking syllable U·Lol and split the greatest warrior to have ever lived into a thousand billion realms, and thus created the trichiliocosm.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Prereq:</strong> Ferocity Mantra</p><p><strong>Spend 2 Beats</strong> to take on the <strong>Hibiscus Laughs Stance</strong> until the end of your next Fulmination.
