Be the thing that floats over it all.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Prereq:</strong> Sea and Storm Dance</p><p><strong>Spend 1 Beat</strong> to take on the <strong>Foe Stepping Stance</strong> until you suffer hits.While in this Stance,when you Rush and you end your movement in an enemy's or terrain's square, you can rush 2 more, and keep bouncing off of enemy's though you can only bounce off each enemy and terrain once. Vertical terrain counts (ie. Higher terrain).</p><p><strong>Eagle Stepping Style: +1 Beat</strong> to make it so that every fighter you bounce off of suffers 1 Hit.</p><p><strong>Dragon Road: +1 Beat</strong> to make it so that this works with Strides as well, not just Rush.</p>",
