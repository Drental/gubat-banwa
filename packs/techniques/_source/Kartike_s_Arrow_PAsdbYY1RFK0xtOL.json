    "description": "<blockquote><p>The First Sarimanok Knight was said to have been the son of Siwa, the Triumphant and Auspicious God, who is very frequently known as Rajah Indarapatra of the Thunderclouds in more modern Akai literature. His eldest son, Yskanda Kartike, Archer of the Rainbow Raptor, was said to have come down upon the world upon the Sarimanok that took his father to the moon. There he taught the truths of the Sarimanok Knight, and how to properly befriend them, and how to treat them not as a horse but as a fierce brother. Yskanda Kartike eventually helped the ancient Put’wanon King Sri Bata Shaja conquer much of the Gatusan Isles in an ancient war, now lost to memory.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Prereq:</strong> Sky Cloak Pamaagi</p><p><strong>Spend 1 Beat</strong> to fire a burning arrow of incandescent fulgur: Ranged Fire Bravery Attack vs 1 target in range 4.
