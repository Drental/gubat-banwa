Batala in a humble warrior-king form gathered his warriors together, sitting atop a karakoa. “Gather round, o warriors, and open thine ears. I sing on the topic of Ego, and it is thus: Killing God and Becoming God are goals for the lesser-minded chained to the cycle of rebirth. Embrace Violence and find Glory beyond God.”</p></blockquote><p><strong>Prereq:</strong> Hibiscus Laughs Sutra</p><p><strong>Spend 1 Beat</strong> to dominate 1 fighter in range 3: they <strong>Inflict Violence</strong> if they can, with a target chosen by you.</p><p><strong>Headfirst Into Death: +1 Beat</strong> to let the target stride before or after Inflict Violence.</p><p><strong>Mass Domination: +1 Beat</strong> to choose any number of fighters in burst 2</p>",
