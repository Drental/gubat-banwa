The target of this benefit is imbued with the speed of an unsheathing sword.<br>An advanced technique that is hard to perfect but unfortunately is probably the most important ability of all Bladeweavers. This is a favorite of Master Samasida, a wily hermit found in the island of Bakara near the Ruins of Samrasat, where he studies with wandering souls of that ancient civilization.</p></blockquote><p>When you make a melee attack,choose 1 ally in range 3 (or yourself). They gain <strong>1 Tiyempo</strong>. When they gain <strong>3 Tiyempo</strong>, they immediately gain <strong>Haste</strong> for the next Strike. While they have Haste, they move first in a Strike, before any other fighter.</p><p><strong>At Strike 3+, spend 1 Beat</strong> to can activate Minor Liberation. Every time you Stride, Move, or Rush, you may teleport that much instead. At <strong>Strike 4+</strong>, inflict1 True Hit on every enemy in the battlefield when you teleport.</p><p>If you are <strong>Defeated</strong> while you have Minor Liberation Activated, you vanish from reality, unravelling from material.</p>",
