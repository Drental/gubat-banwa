Thus follow their way: burrow, spiral, destroy. All things will be broken through. That is the art of piercing. Who needs a spear when bullets can pierce through hearts just as well?</p></blockquote><p><strong>Spend 1 Beat</strong> to take on the <strong>Kalabit Diablo Stance</strong> until the end of your next Fulmination. When you deal 2+ Hits on an attack, consume the stance and then roll a d4: fire a number of bullets equal to the result of the d4 at any enemy in range 3, inflicting 1 True Hit per Bullet. Each possible target must be struck at least once first before inflicting Bullets at the same enemy more than once.</p>",
