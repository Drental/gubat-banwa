The second lesson is this: throw the arrow back. Sri Taka is a legendary folk hero among Apumbukid, a Hinapanun noble who fought against a Virbanwan iron foundry village that seeked to kill the diwata of the forest Ibusi, Apu Ibusi.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Prereq:</strong> Wind Breathing Style</p><p><strong>Spend 1 Beat</strong> to ready yourself, taking on the <strong>Si Taka Catches Arrows Stance</strong> until you are forcibly moved. While in this stance, when you are the target of a ranged attack, roll a Chance Die. On a 4+, redirect the attack against any other fighter within range 4 or back at the attacker. Then Rush 2 after the attack.</p><p><strong>Pillars of Heaven: +1 Beat</strong> to immediately rush 3 and gain <strong>POS Up</strong> while in the Stance.</p><p><strong>Twin Naga: +1 Beat</strong> to ready yourself: at any point during your Fulmination, consume the Stance for 1 Beat to <strong>inflict violence twice</strong> without <strong>Combo Breaker</strong>.</p>",
