A technick perfected by Sword Poet Sialo Baguna I, a King who spurned rulership to travel with a troupe of professional singers. This requires a quick wit and an even quicker tongue: you perform a poem so quickly that your sword swings are bolstered to follow the rhythm, so fast that it creates a physical barrier of strikes.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Prereq:</strong> Sword Ambahan</p><p><strong>Spend 1 Beat</strong> to take on the <strong>Shield Song Stance</strong> until the end of your next Fulmination. While in this stance, all melee attacks against you hit only on 7+, even with Sharpness.</p><p><strong>Godpoet Wings: +1 Beat</strong> to make it so that when you Stride, you may teleport your SPD instead while in the Stance.</p><p><strong>Dancing Nataraja: +1 Beat</strong> to rush 1 after taking the Stance and then gain <strong>Stability</strong> while in the Stance.</p>",
