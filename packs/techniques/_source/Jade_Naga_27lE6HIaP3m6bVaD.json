By brandishing a Jade Naga you create a spiritual boundary that prevents the targets of your hatred from inflicting violence.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Prereq:</strong> Gilded Kinnara</p><p><strong>Spend 1 Beat</strong> to summon a <strong>Jade Naga:</strong> choose a <strong>path 3</strong>. Summon a Jade Naga on that path, a <strong>Durability 6 Object</strong>. The object is <strong>blocking terrain</strong> that cannot be climbed and cannot be shot over, as the naga now guards it. Push 1 any target in the chosen path away from the path.</p><p>Nagaraja: +1 Beat to exalt the naga, and now it swims: every end of your Fulmination, you may choose a new Path that is adjacent to at least one of the Naga’s squares. The Naga teleports into those squares.</p><p>Breathing Violence: +1 Beat to choose a square adjacent to one of the squares of the naga. That square becomes Fire Terrain for as long as it is adjacent to the naga, and cannot be changed.</p>",
