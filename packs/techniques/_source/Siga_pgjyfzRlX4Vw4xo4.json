Siga!” A popular mudra amongst Makinaadmanon that truly encapsulates their position as magickal artillery. This spell was perfected by Makinaadmanon warriors that needed to sneak through ancient temples guarded by Akai invaders.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Spend 1 Beat</strong> to perform Siga: make a Ranged Fire Faith Attack vs 1 fighter in range 5, then inflict <strong>Fray 1</strong>.</p><p><strong>Spend 2 Beats</strong> to perform <strong>Kusiga:</strong> Change the attack to <strong>Area Fire Faith Attack vs range 4 burst 1.</strong></p><p><strong>Spend 3 Beats</strong> to perform <strong>Devasiga.</strong> As with Kusiga but with the following effect: all squares in the burst become <strong>Fire Terrain</strong>.</p>",
