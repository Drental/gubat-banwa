The Heavenspear is not impeded by the battlefield. All obstacles are simply things that must be vaulted over. Heavenspear Hinalus sped through an entire forest to strike at a warrior resting within the mouth of a river.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Spend 1 Beat</strong> to strike heavenward with your weapon: make a <strong>Melee Air Bravery Attack</strong> vs 1 adjacent fighter, and then inflict <strong>Juggle (1)</strong> on the target.</p><p><strong>Sky Rave: +1 Beat</strong> to gain a Hawk Eagle Token. When an enemy in range 3 ticks down their Juggle duration, discard the Token to teleport to a square adjacent to them and inflict violence.</p><p><strong>Hawk Eagle Dance: +1 Beat</strong> to change the attack to <strong>Area Metal Bravery Attack vs all enemies in Line 5</strong>.</p>",
