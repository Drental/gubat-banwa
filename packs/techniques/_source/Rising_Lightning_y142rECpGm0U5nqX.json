Taught by Abusung Samudela, a once master of low moving Skysea Raiding, he perfected this after mixing the styles together, and created one of the most dangerous attacks in Heaven Rending.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Prereq:</strong> Plummeting Thunder</p><p><strong>Spend 1 Beat</strong> to burst up like lightning from your soul: make an <strong>Metal Bravery Attack vs 1 adjacent fighter</strong>. Inflict +1 Hit if the target has <strong>Juggle</strong>, <strong>Flying</strong>, or <strong>Float</strong>. Inflict +1 Hit if the target has higher HP than you.</p><p><strong>Antiroyal Blade: +1 Beat</strong> to turn one of the defenderâ€™s Defense Teeth into a d6.</p><p><strong>Kingkiller Vajra: +1 Beat</strong> to change the attack to an <strong>Area Bravery Attack vs all enemies in burst 1</strong>.</p>",
