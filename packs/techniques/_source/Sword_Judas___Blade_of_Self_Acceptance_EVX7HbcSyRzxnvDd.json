The perfection of this technique is a recalling of its past version in the Bladesong: becoming the Sword is to realize one's self, the perfection of mindfulness within one's place in nature.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Prereq:</strong> Blade of Makaubos | Lawana Shrikes</p><p><strong>Spend 1 Beat</strong> to gain the <strong>Sword Judas Token</strong>, of which you can only have 1 of at a time. When you are the target of a <strong>Melee or Ranged Attack</strong>, you may discard the Token to immediately cancel that attack against you, and then inflict <strong>Unbalance (2)</strong> at the attacker.</p><p><strong>Sword Provocation: +1 Beat</strong> to also gain a <strong>Burst 2</strong> aura that moves with you. All enemies in the burst gain <strong>Provoke</strong> to you. Discarding the token removes the aura.</p><p><strong>Betrayal: +1 Beat</strong> to also <strong>teleport 2</strong> both you and the attacker after discarding the Token.</p>",
