In Virbanwa, Mahadiwa Kalakatri Duumanun is known as Saint Qali, Patron of Vengeance. She doesn't like it herself. Who are they to name her differently? She cares not, of course. She knows her name, what mortals call her does not change her nature. Thus is the truth of nature.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Prereq:</strong> Sibat Caligo</p><p><strong>Spend 1 Beat</strong> to take on the <strong>Solemnidad Stance</strong> until the end of your next Fulmination.
