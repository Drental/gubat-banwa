When Something Fails, Make It Succeed!” - Sipa Master Hanahayan.</p><p>“Why do you kick, Karipal?”<br>“For the same reason as you, Banas. To become the lightning.”<br>“You will not find it in the arena, you know this.”<br>“No. But every time I look at you… I find I am able to seize heaven’s thunderclaps.”</p></blockquote><p><strong>Prereq:</strong> Giant Scaring Boast</p><p><strong>Spend 1 Beats</strong> to <strong>rush SPD</strong>, and then gain a <strong>Rolling Thunder Token</strong>. Discard the Token when a ranged attack’s line of effect goes through your spaces or any space adjacent to you, Deflect the attack, targeting a space or fighter in range 3. Then rush 2.</p><p><strong>Burning Star Vanquish: +1 Beat</strong> to give yourself <strong>SPD Up (2)</strong> and <strong>BRV Up (2)</strong> before you Rush.</p><p><strong>Crashing Scintilla:</strong> Upgrade the Token to a Crashing Scintilla Token. As with Rolling Thunder, but while you have a Crashing Scintilla, whenever an enemy starts their Fulmination, Rush 1. You lose Crashing Scintilla at the start of your next Fulmination.</p>",
