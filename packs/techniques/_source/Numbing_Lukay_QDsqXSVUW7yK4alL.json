Flower seeds, petals, and crushed insects steeped in hot water have been wrapped in a heart-shaped lukay. This, when applied forcibly, envelops The Immortal with a moment of Hiyang, making them one with all things for one moment.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Prereq:</strong> Gahum Dampening Ointment</p><p><strong>Spend 1 Beat</strong> to make an adjacent ally immune to all hits on the next attack against them.
