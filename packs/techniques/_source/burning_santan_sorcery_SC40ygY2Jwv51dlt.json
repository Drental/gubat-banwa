A mentala that summons a thicket of thick and hard to move through foliage. It is wrapped in phantom flame.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Prereq:</strong> Vampire Orchid Promulgation</p><p><strong>Spend 1 Beat</strong> to burn a place: choose a square in range 4. A Burst 1 <strong>Fireflower Field</strong> erupts from it until the end of your next Fulmination: any enemy that starts their Fulmination in the Field suffers <strong>Fray 1</strong> and <strong>Eviscerate (1)</strong>. When the Fireflower Field disappears, all squares within the Field become Fire Terrain.</p><p><strong>Blossoming Sampaguita: +1 Beat</strong> to increase the Field to Burst 2.</p><p><strong>Divine Flower Aflame: +1 Beat</strong> to inflict <strong>Fray 3</strong> on each enemy in the burst when you put down the field.</p>",
