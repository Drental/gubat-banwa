This is because a ruler's powerbase in the isles depend on how much virtue or merit the commonfolk see that you have. If they realize that another, different warrior-brave or king has a more powerful claim to royalty, whether it be divine heritage, bloodline, or superior ultraviolence, then they will switch allegiance on a dime, following the more powerful one. Why would you follow a nonvirtuous person? If you followed a virtuous leader, then you will cultivate virtue yourself.” - Sermons on Virtue and Rulership by Sri Kadasiga Mahawagas</p></blockquote><p>Your adjacency is increased to all squares within range 2 of you, instead of just everything within 1 square of you.</p><p><strong>At Strike 2+, for 1 Beat,</strong> you can give the greatest command: All allies in the battlefield gain <strong>5 Thunderbolt Tokens</strong>.</p>",
