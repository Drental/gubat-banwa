The Guardian Lions are the protectors of dharma, and in so doing, protect kings and queens who must be essential to the keeping of dharma. Recently, however, the guardian lions have slowly shirked from their responsibility.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Prereq:</strong> Gilded Kinnara</p><p><strong>Spend 1 Beat</strong> to summon a stone guardian lion in a square adjacent to you, which is a <strong>Size 1 Object</strong>.
