All your strikes will find their way. When this Mentala is encanted, warriors take upon the fierce visages of wild cats and tigers.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Prereq:</strong> Hito Mentala</p><p><strong>Spend 1 Beat</strong> to sharpen your claws against the bones of your enemies: make a <strong>Ranged Earth Faith Attack</strong> vs <strong>1 fighter in range 3</strong>, then Mark yourself until the end of your next Fulmination or an ally in range 3 until the end of their next Fulmination. While marked, all Melee and Ranged Attacks generate Hits on a 4+, even with Dullness.</p><p><strong>Harimau Blessing: +1 Beat</strong> to mark yourself until the end of your next Fulmination and all allies in burst 2 until the end of their next Fulmination.</p>",
