The fabled witch dogs or asonanggubat (forest dog) are some of the most vicious dogs, that only the most skilled of hunters can summon. These black-mouthed, large and wide-shouldered dogs have severely sharp claws that regularly shed, making it so that their claws are always sharp.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Prereq:</strong> Pit Trap Technique, Gilded Hound Nails</p><p><strong>Spend 1 Beat</strong> to summon a <strong>Size 1 Witch Dog</strong> in a square adjacent to you, which shares your <strong>Martial Abilities</strong>.
