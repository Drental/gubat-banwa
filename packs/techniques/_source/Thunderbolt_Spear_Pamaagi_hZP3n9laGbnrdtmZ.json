And our kind, all we do is fight. We engage in such violence that the gods look away, and the devils bow down in the grandeur of our bloodshed. Like a river, it flows. It ever cycles: our violence flows to the sea of time, and then simply returns to the peak of the mountain through the rain. Will there ever be a time that our warring nations will achieve peace? Or is peace simply not a portion of our nature? Who is to dictate our nature?<br>I bring this spear and shield before you, great Brother Thunderbolt, so that I may slay you, and perhaps I will free my people from this horrible cycle. The river flows, Diwasin Kilat, God of Lightning, but perhaps I can stop it.” - The Song of the Rajaraya</p></blockquote><p><strong>Prereq:</strong> Panglima Palms</p><p><strong>Spend 1 Beat</strong> to push 2 an adjacent enemy, and then an ally in range 3 may inflict violence.</p><p><strong>Yaksha Decapitating Kampilan: +1 Beat</strong> to Inflict Violence instead of Pushing.</p><p><strong>Crimson Pudong Attainment: +1 Beat</strong> to let all allies that you can see inflict violence if they can or want to instead.</p>",
