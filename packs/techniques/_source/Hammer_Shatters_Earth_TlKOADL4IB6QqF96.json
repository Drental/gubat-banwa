Their strikes are thus universal, across all weapons, a skill and feature that makes them feared across the martial arts world.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Spend 1 Beat</strong> to strike down with a hammer: make a <strong>Melee Metal Bravery Attack</strong> vs 1 adjacent fighter, inflicting <strong>Knockdown</strong>. While knocked down, they cannot move voluntarily. They must spend 1 Beat to stand up, removing Knockdown.</p><p><strong>Gada Breaker: +1 Beat</strong> to change the attack into an <strong>Area Earth Bravery Attack</strong> vs all enemes in blast 3.
