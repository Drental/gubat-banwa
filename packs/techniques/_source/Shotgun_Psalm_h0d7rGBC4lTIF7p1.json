I am Mangkukulam, and my flame shall never die. Not even God can extinguish my fire with His drool.” Send a barrage across the entire battlefield, as if you summon bullets and arrows from the gods. You impart the divine grace of your diwata upon the battlefield. 777 arms carry 777 guns about you.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Prereq:</strong> Crimson Steel Rain</p><p><strong>Spend 1 Beat</strong> to fire a psalm: Ranged Air Faith Attack vs 1 fighter in range 4, then inflict <strong>Fire Vulnerability (2)</strong>.</p><p><strong>Scarlet Mission: +1 Beat</strong> to change the attack to: Area Fire Faith Attack vs all fighters in <strong>Path 6</strong>.</p><p><strong>Fires of Mangkukulam: +1 Beat</strong> to turn the squares of the targets into <strong>Fire Terrain</strong>.</p>",
