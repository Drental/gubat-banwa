While holding the chunk of earth, you have cover. When you are attacked while you have a chunk of earth, roll a Chance Die after the attack. On a 5-, the rock shatters away.</p><p><strong>Throw Rock: For 1 Beat</strong> while you have a chunk of earth, you can throw it at any square in range 4, putting down a Size 1 Boulder on the square, and inflicting Push 1 on all fighters adjacent to the square (including any target on the chosen square).</p>",
