Sarimanok Knights are known for being one of the quickest warriors in the lands, able to fight and hunt down skyships.<br>An ancient story about the Sarimanok is about how the Elder Rajah Indarapatra, King of Mournful Compassion, fell in love with a certain Moon Spirit, said to have been later an incarnation of Baginda Sumongsuklay herself. When the Moon Spirit, named Bayi Bulan, ascended to the moon, Indarapatra wept, until a sarimanok that was his umalagad for so long offered to take him to the moon, where Indarapatra is said to now live in eternal happiness.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Prereq:</strong> Manaul Stone Raid</p><p><strong>Spend 1 Beat</strong> to take on the <strong>Sky Cloak Stance</strong>.
