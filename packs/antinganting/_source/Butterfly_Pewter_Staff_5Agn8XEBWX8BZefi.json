The scarlet butterfly is an important symbol of metamorphosis and symbiosis for the First Makinaadmanon, who ascertained that it was nature's beauty, cyclical nature and inherent unity condensed into a single being. Its fluttering and beauty is brief, but the fact that it ends make it important, and the spores it spreads with its wings ensure that life continues evermore.</em></p><p><strong>Effect:</strong> Whenever you end your Fulmination, <strong>heal 1</strong> all adjacent allies.</p>"
