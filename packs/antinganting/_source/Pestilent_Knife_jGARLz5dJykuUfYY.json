Virulences and plagues are said to belong to the old Sky God, who was so distant from mortals that he does not know the threat of plagues upon them.</em></p><p><strong>Effect:</strong> Every 10 on Attack Teeth against fighters inflict a stack of <strong>Pestilence</strong>. While they have Pestilence, they cannot be healed, cannot gain Boons, and suffer <strong>-1d</strong> to all Defense Teeth.</p>"
